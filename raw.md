# Canons

In the course of Bach’s music INTRO INTRO INTRO

I became interested in canons through Douglas Hofstadter’s book, _Gödel, Escher, Bach_, which approaches them not just as musical compositions but as constructs of mathematics and logic. Canons are constructed from a theme and a deceptively simple set of rules. The form, in the hands of a master like Bach, allows composers to create works of logical as well as musical beauty.

Canons are built around a “theme”—a particular melody upon which it is based, and which is repeated by several “voices” that carry it through the piece. You’re probably familiar with pieces like this. Rounds, like “Frére Jacques” or “Row Your Boat”, are the simplest of all canons: the piece simply consists of the theme repeated over itself by distinct voices. In a canon, however, the theme can be altered in certain ways for each voice.

Most of the examples I’ll discuss here are from Bach’s “Hudemann canon” (named for its dedicatee, a Monsieur Houdemann). Although not highly regarded now, during Bach’s lifetime it may have been his most famous piece for its clever construction. Its theme is simple, only nine notes:

[theme]

but from this theme, several different “solutions” to the canon can be formed.

Nearly all canons rely on some amount of delay between the canon’s voices, as in a round. The simplest form beyond this also shifts the theme in pitch. The solution Bach gave to J.S. Walther relies on only these two techniques:

[walther]

The Walther solution has four voices, starting on G, C, A, and D, and staggered by a half-measure. Played together, these four voices form a harmonious whole, with overlapping notes. (Show/highlight octaves, fifths, thirds, etc?)

In most modern music that uses multiple voices, one of them plays an emphasized melody and the others play supporting harmonies. Canons, however, can have no supporting harmonies—all of the voices are carrying the same theme. The theme and its various altered versions must all harmonize with one another. This approach to music, with multiple, interdependent melodies that harmonize together (called _counterpoint_), is at the core of the logical complexity of canons. It is a hallmark of Bach’s music.

In addition to time and pitch, canon voices can flip their theme upside-down. Friedrich Marpurg’s solution to the canon does just this:

[marpurg]

Again, while the theme remains the same, harmonic patterns emerge throughout the piece. (Octaves, Fifths, Thirds).

When Bach published the Hudemann Canon, he did so in a rather cryptic notation, showing the theme and decorating it with a number of hints at ways to rearrange the theme to form pleasing canons. This is often called a “puzzle canon”, and it’s why I’ve been referring to realizations of the canon as “solutions”. This is the musical equivalent of a crossword puzzle, and musical scholars like Marpurg must have spent hours working out the solutions Bach hinted at (or perhaps even ones he never imagined!).

Another solution to the canon, by Johann Mattheson, not only inverts the solution, but also puts it into a different key (F minor):

[mattheson]

(octaves, fifths, thirds)

The final two (known) solutions—there may be others—to Hudemann’s Canon rely on reversing the theme (frequently called canons “in retrograde”). The first simply reverses them all:

[retrograde]

(octaves, fifths, thirds)

The second both reverses *and* inverts them, combining all of the techniques we’ve listed so far:

[retro-inversion]

(octaves, fifths, thirds)

These transformations are somewhat harder to see, but still follow the same patterns as before.

The final transition is in tempo… [find canon]
